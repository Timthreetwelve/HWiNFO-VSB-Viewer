The HWiNFO VSB Viewer ReadMe file


Introduction
============
HWiNFO VSB Viewer is an application that will read the HWiNFO VSB registry values and display them
in a grid. The Index values shown in the grid can then be used in Rainmeter skins.

This app gets the same information from the registry as the reg query
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\HWiNFO64\VSB command and then puts it in an easy to use grid.


Using HWiNFO VSB Viewer
=======================

Click the three-lined (hamburger) icon at the top left and use the bar that appears on the left for
page navigation.

The first screen displays the registry information found at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\HWiNFOxx\VSB.
From here you can filter to find text quickly. In the filter box you can enter one ~ (tilde) as a
shortcut to filter items that have the degree symbol (u00b0). To the right of the filter box there
are three icons that have menu selections for copying the grid to the clipboard, to a CSV file or to
an HTML file. There are also options to change the size of the display and for refreshing the data.
By clicking on the grid column headers you can sort the columns in the grid.

The second screen is the Settings screen. You can select from five themes. You can select the accent
color and you can choose between seven UI sizes for the app. You can choose the font and font weight
and row spacing in the grid on the first page. There are also options to have the app stay on top of
other windows and you can control the detail of the log file.

You can choose the language used for the user interface, provided that a translation has been
contributed for that language. Checking the ""Use Windows display language"" check box will tell
the app to use the language specified in the Windows settings, which will be used if a translation
is available; otherwise, English (en-US) will be used. The drop-down allows you to choose a
specific language from the list of defined languages. Changing language options will cause the
application to restart.

The last screen is the About screen. This screen shows information about the app such as the version
number and has a link to the GitHub repository where you can check for updates.

You can view the log file or this ReadMe file by clicking on the three dot icon at the right end of
the banner on either the Settings or About screens.

These keyboard shortcuts are available:

	F1 = Go to the About screen
	F5 = Refresh
	Ctrl + A = Change the accent color
	Ctrl + M = Change the theme
	Ctrl + R = Reset column sorts
	Ctrl + S = Change grid row spacing
	Ctrl + W = Change font weight in grid
	Ctrl + comma = Go to the Settings screen

	Ctrl + Numpad Minus or Ctrl + Minus = Decrease size
	Ctrl + Numpad 0 = set size to default
    Ctrl + Shift + F = Open File explorer in the application folder
    Ctrl + Shift + K = Compare current language to default (en-US)
    Ctrl + Shift + S = Open the Settings file
